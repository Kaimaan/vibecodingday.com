        <p class="p-4">Event where people with big ideas come together to Vibe Code <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product" class="text-white">MVPs</a>. Let's support each other, team up and get s*** done faster than ever before. Maybe it can be starting point for something bigger.</p>

            <h2>Why are We Doing This?</h2>
            <p>Every now and then, a major shift in technology unlocks a wave of new possibilities for startups. First came personal computers — which empowered anyone to hack, build, and experiment. Then the internet made it possible to distribute software instantly to anyone, anywhere. And then came app stores, which turned distribution into discovery — giving developers direct access to global audiences, along with tools to monetize and scale like never before.</p>
            <p>Now, we're stepping into a new chapter — the era of Vibe Coding. Era where productivity takes leap forward and building applications becomes easier for people who do not have any prior experience.</p>

            <h2>Before the Event</h2>
            <p>Before the event, join the Slack channel and invite all your friends. If you have time, get familiar with the tools and practices. Doing so will help you focus more during the actual event day. Also, in Slack, we can share ideas and look for opportunities to team up with other Vibe Coders to learn and build something together.</p>

            <h2>Organiser(s)</h2>
            <p>I'm <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kai-lemmetty/">Kai Lemmetty</a>. I have been into startups and building things online for as long as I can remember. Coming up with ideas and turning them into something real — that's pretty much been my thing.</p>
            <p>But let's face it, doing your own thing can get a bit lonely sometimes. That's why, back in 2007, I started putting together casual after-work beers for other startup folks with my good friend Joonas. Then in early 2008, I kicked off Startup Developers Gathering — a chill meetup for startup devs to swap ideas, help each other out, and try to build something big. Later that year, I teamed up with Helene Auramo, Ville Vesterinen, and Peter Vesterbacka to get the very first <a href="https://slush.org/">Slush</a> off the ground.</p>
            <p>All of that happened during a time when the internet was reshaping how we build and share — and when the global economy was on shaky ground. It felt like something big was shifting, and we needed community more than ever.</p>
            <p>Now… it feels like we're at one of those moments again. A new shift. And I think it's time we rally together again — to build, to share, and to push things forward.</p>
